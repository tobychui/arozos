            <h1>Hi there! It seems you have screwed up your system really badly. </h1>
            <p>You are seeing this error because you try to do the followings</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reinstalling ArozOS on the same host with the same IP address and session key</li>
                <li>Trying to copy the ArozOS files to the new image without reinstalling the system</li>
                <li>The browser cached the old login session key and ask the new server to login with the old key</li>
            </ul> 
            <p>And hence, the bootloader blocked your access to the main system due to security reasons.</p>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <p>In any case, this can be easily solved by pressing the Logout link below and re-login again.</p>
            <p>Press the link below to logout, after seeing "OK", get back to the login page and login again.</p>
