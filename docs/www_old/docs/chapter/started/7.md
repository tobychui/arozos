## User Interface Structure

In arozos, the original “Grid Interface” introduced in Beta has been removed due to most users will just directly launch into their Desktop interface. For that, a new interface is introduced to replace the grid interface as the default interface module for mobile devices. In the arozos UI implementation, the system default supports three kinds of UI.

1. Web Desktop Interface
2. Mobile Desktop Interface
3. Interface Module Interface

For beta version of aroz, the interface includes

1. Grid Menu Interface
2. Web Desktop Interface
3. Multi System Booting Interface (MSBI)

### Web Desktop Interface

The arozos Web Desktop Interface is a complete rewritten of the original desktop interface and provides better user experience compared to the Beta Desktop.

For basic usage, the Web Desktop supports creating new folders, uploading Files by drag drop, double click opening files, folder or application shortcuts etc. See Desktop for more information.

In arozos 1.0, a top menu is added to show time, volume info and Ubuntu 20.04, also provide a notification bar as well as a quick dropdown function menu for access to quick functions including full screen toggle, system settings and user logout.



### Mobile Desktop Interface

Mobile Desktop Interface was first introduce in arozos 1.105 for supporting vertical screens (Mostly mobile devices). In this mode, the floatWindow is still supported with limited functions. The list menu and toolbar are also replaced with a sidebar instead. However, this interface did allow multi-processing just like the standard Desktop interface. 



| List Menu                                                 | Tool Sidebar                                            | Opening Applications                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |

### Grid Menu Interface

The Grid Menu interface is a deprecated interface designed for ArOZ Online Beta (AOB) users for using the system on mobile devices. It is also the first interface of the ArOZ Online System that provides access to all system modules within one interface.

This interface is deprecated and no longer available on the arozos 1.0. This function has been replaced by the List Men on the mobile desktop interface, and there is no method to enable this feature in arozos 1.0.

### IMUS Multi System Booting Interface (MSBI / IMSB)

MSBI is the original method for binding service together using a bootloader like system for aroz online beta. It provides a very basic portal for redirecting users to different network services within the same host environment.

For example, multiple of ArOZ Online Beta can be installed on the same machine using the MSBI tool as the main router.

This interface has been deprecated and replaced by the subservice module (functional wise) and permission group interface module settings (Selection wise). For more detail, see the “Interface Module” section.
