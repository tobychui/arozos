## Examples

Here are some examples for using arozos in different situations

### Basics

- Change port to port 80
- Change hostname to "My Network Disk"

```
./arozos -port 80 -hostname "My Network Disk"
```



### Enable TLS support (aka HTTPS)

- Enable TLS
- Change port to 443
- Load the cert and key from file

For v1.112 or below

```
./arozos -port 443 -tls=true -cert "mycert.crt" -key "mykey.key"
```

For v1.113 or above

```
./arozos -tls_port 443 -tls=true -cert "mycert.crt" -key "mykey.key"
```

**Note that since v1.113, when TLS mode is enabled,  HTTP server will not switch off automatically. If you want to ONLY ENABLE HTTPS over TLS and shutdown HTTP access, you can disable it with the disable_http flag  (Note the last flag value)**

```
./arozos -tls_port 443 -tls=true -cert "mycert.crt" -key "mykey.key" -disable_http=true
```

This feature is implemented so that you can run both HTTP and HTTPS server for fallback purposes if a browser or environment didn't support self signed certificated or some webapp requires HTTPS while some don't.  One of the example of this usage is to fix the problem of unable to full screen a PWA using self signed cert or you are using a network that cannot be linked to a domain.



### Access From Outside Home

Use case: You have a gateway NAT router with public IP address and you want to access your ArozOS Host outside your home with your public IP address

- Enable UPNP
- Don't use Port 80
- Disable IP resolver (as it will always be your NAT router address anyway)

```
./arozos -allow_upnp=true -port 8123 -disable_ip_resolver=true
```

*This operation will require your router to support UPnP function. If not, skip the "allow-upnp" flag and setup port forward in the router instead.*

### Deploying on Cloud VM 

Use case: Deploying on AWS, Linode / Ramnode  or Azure

- Disable network discovery functions (as it is under virtual network anyway)
- Disable package install to prevent changing to the production environment
- Disable dir listing so users can't scan what files is located within the web server
- Disable hardware management as there is no real hardware in VM
- Disable IP resolver )in case you are running under reverse proxy, which in production environment is quite common)

```
./arozos -allow_mdns=false -allow_pkg_install=false -allow_ssdp=false -dir_list=false -enable_hwman=false -disable_ip_resolve=true
```

By default gzip is enabled. If you want to waste some bandwidth on your Cloud VM, you can turn it off via adding the gzip flag to the above command.

```
-gzip=false
```



### Deploying on Ultra Low Memory Single Board Computers

Use case: deploy on Pi zero w, ZeroPi or Orange Pi Zero that only has 512MB or even 256MB RAM 

- Lower the IO operation buffer (Optional)
- Lower upload buffer memory from 25MB to 10MB

*Under low memory environment (< 2GB RAM), ArozOS will automatically switch to "low memory upload mode" in which it will use WebSocket chunk based upload instead of Form Post Upload method.*

```
./arozos -iobuf 512 -upload_buf 10
```



### Deploying on a Thin Client that its primary drive only has less than 16GB space

Use case: 2nd hand thin client as NAS, Really tight budget personal cloud storage build

**Assume you have an external storage devices  (e.g. an external SSD ) plugged in and mounted as /media/storage**

- Move user root and tmp folders outside of the installation disk
- Reduce max file upload size from 8GB to 25MB

```
./arozos -tmp "/media/storage/" -root "./media/storage/files/" -max_upload_size 25
```



### Deploying as the Server for Automated Services / Panels

Use case: Weather station, digital billboard and other IoT devices that require auto login

- Enable Auto Login

```
./arozos -allow_autologin=true
```

and follow up the setting in the Auto Login Mode System Setting tab
