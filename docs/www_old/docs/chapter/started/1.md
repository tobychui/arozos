# Remarks
## Legacy Version of ArOZ 
The previous release of the arozos is named &quot;ArOZ Online System&quot; or &quot;ArOZ Online Beta&quot; (AOB). For information and documentation for the beta version of this system, please read the &quot;ArOZ Online Distributed Cloud System Documentation&quot; instead.

You can classify the difference between these two systems by identifying the programming language of the system.

| Version | Programming Language | File Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ArOZ Online Beta | PHP5 / PHP7 | .php |
| ArOZ OS (ArOZ Online 1.0) | Go | .go |

ArOZ OS is written as &quot;arozos&quot; in the current documentation for simplicity and easy to read purposes.
