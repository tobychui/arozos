# System Functions via VDI
VDI provides many system functions for quick access through the function bar for the ease of 
system control on a desktop environment.

## Virtual File Explorer (VFE)
The Virtual File Explorer bridge the gap between web application and real operating system.
The AOB VFE can perform all the task an OS provides with a web based interface. Including file move
, delete, copy, cut,rename and paste. The VFE also support new folder, download and upload.

By double click on any files, VFE will try to open the file in a new window if the file type is
supported. If the user double click on directory, the file list will be updated to list all the
files inside the selected directory.

To exit a directory, simpily click the back button or click the first item in the directory list
for exiting the current directory and back to its parent directory.
