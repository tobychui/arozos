## Installation

Require GO 1.14 or above (See [Instllation tutorial](https://dev.to/tobychui/install-go-on-raspberry-pi-os-shortest-tutorial-4pb))

Run the following the command to build the system

```
git clone https://github.com/tobychui/arozos
cd ./arozos/src/
go build
./arozos 
#sudo ./arozos for enabling hardware and WiFi management features
```

(Yes, it is that simple)

## Deploy

### For Raspberry Pi (For Raspberry Pi 4B+)

If you are using Raspberry Pi as your host, you can download one of the images and flash the image into your SD card. You will find a new network device named "ArozOS (ARxxx)" pop up in your "Network Neighbourhood". Double click the icon and you will be redirect to the system Web setup interface. If you cannot find the new device in your network, you can also connect to the ArozOS directly via ```http://{raspberry_pi_ip_address}:8080/```



**All the image listed above require 8GB or above microSD card**

To optain the .img file, you can unzip the compressed image using 7zip. If you don't have it, you can get it [here](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)

### For All Pi models

#### Build from source using installer script (Recommended)

Since v1.119, arozos pre-build image has been moved from the original Raspberry Pi OS 32-bit to 64-bit for better utilization of system resources. For older version of Pis, you can install arozos with the command below with a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobychui/arozos/master/installer/install_for_pi.sh | bash
```

or without curl

```
cd ~/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tobychui/arozos/master/installer/install_for_pi.sh
sudo chmod 775 ./install_for_pi.sh
./install_for_pi.sh
```

The installer will install all the required dependencies including ffmpeg and go compiler. To confirm installation success, check for the execution status of arozos using the following command.

```
sudo systemctl status arozos
```

#### Using prebuilt binary

See installation steps for other ARM SBC (but use the ```arozos_linux_arm``` binary instead of ```arozos_linux_arm64```)

### For other ARM SBC(e.g. Orange Pi / Banana Pi / Friendly ARM's Pis)

Download the correct architecture binary from the "release" tab and upload the binary with the "web" and "system" folder in "/src".
After upload, you should have the following file structure

```
$ ls
arozos_linux_arm64  web  system
```

Start the binary by calling ``` sudo ./arozos_linux_arm64 ``` (or without sudo if you prefer no hardware management)

### Windows

If you are deploying on Windows, you need to add ffmpeg to %PATH% environment variable.

This system can be built and run on Windows hosts with the following build instructions

```
# Download the whole repo as zip and cd into it
cd .\arozos\src\
go build
arozos.exe
```

**However, not all features are available for Windows**.

### ArozOS Launcher (Required for OTA Update support)

See https://github.com/aroz-online/launcher

### Storage Configuration

#### Deploying Single Machine

If you are deploying single machine, you can visit System Setting > Disk & Storage > Storage Pools and edit the "system" storage pool for setting up the global storage pools for all users in the system.

![](img/screenshots/sp.png)

#### Deploying on Multiple Machines

If you are deploying on multiple machines, you can take a look at the storage configuration file located in:

```
src/system/storage.json.example
```

Rename the storage.json.example to storage.json and start arozos. The required virtual storage drives will be mounted accordingly.

## ArOZ JavaScript Gateway Interface (AGI) / Plugin Loader

The ArOZ AJGI / AGI interface provide a javascript programmable interface for ArOZ Online users to create 
plugin for the system. To initiate the module, you can place a "init.agi" file in the web directory of the module
(also named the module root). See more details in the ![AJGI Documentation](https://github.com/tobychui/arozos/blob/master/src/AGI%20Documentation.md).

## ArozOS OTA Update Launcher

Since v1.119, ArozOS can perform OTA update with the help of the [ArozOS Launcher](https://github.com/aroz-online/launcher). See the launcher's github repo for installation instructions.
